# Session 6 – Intermediate Programming – Data Structures and Binary Search

## Lesson Goal

Down the rabbit hole we go. By the end of the lesson, students should understand various data structures, their Python equivalents, and their relevance in modern software development.

## Key Terms

- Lists
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sets
- Hash Tables
- User-defined data structures
- Binary Search

## Performance Criteria (ICTPRG443: 2.3, 2.4)

### 1. Introduction to Data Structures

- Define what a data structure is.
- Explain their relevance to modern software development.
- Provide a brief overview of common data structures.

### 2. Deep Dive into Selected Structures with Python

- **Lists and Arrays:** Discuss similarities, differences, and Python implementations.
- **Linked Lists:** Introduce the concept of nodes and pointers.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Use Python's `collections.deque` as an example.
- **Trees, DAGs, and Graphs:** Introduce concepts and applications.
- **Sets and Hash Tables:** Demonstrate Python's built-in `set` and `dict` and their use cases.

### 3. Introduction to Binary Search

- Explain the concept and efficiency of binary search.
- Code a guessing game as an example.

### 4. Python's Language-Provided Facilities for Sorted Data Structures

- Demonstrate the use of `sorted()`, `sort()`, and the `bisect` module.
- Highlight Python’s flexibility in handling sorted structures.

### 5. Short Activities

- **Activity 1:** Implement a basic stack using lists.
- **Activity 2:** Create a number guessing game with an AI that optimally solves it.

### 6. Work on KBA Part 1 (90 min Allocation)
